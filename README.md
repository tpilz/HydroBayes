# HydroBayes
Collection of R functions with sampling algorithms for use in a hydrological context employing Bayesian statistics

## DESCRIPTION
The package provides a number of functions with MCMC-based algorithms to sample probability distribution functions. The function are designed for the use in hydrological applications.

## WARNING
The package was devloped for personal use. Most of the sampling function contain the mere algorithm but are lacking any "cosmetics" such as argument checks etc. If you want to use the package, you should therefore take some care and you should know what you are doing.

I recommend the use of this package primarily to get acquainted with the algorithms.

## INSTALLATION

* command line installation (requiring the package devtools):

```R
install.packages("devtools") 
library(devtools)
install_github("tpilz/HydroBayes")
```
